/**
 * Unified subscription helpers.
 *
 * Events flow over the engine WebSocket (topic-scoped). The only calls that
 * still use Tauri IPC are OS-level events (`app-activated`, `sync-connection`)
 * that the webview emits locally without going through the engine.
 *
 * Callers should NOT import `listen` from `@tauri-apps/api/event` — go
 * through this module so any future transport switch stays in one place.
 *
 * Topic model: the desktop app subscribes to the engine's firehose (`"*"`),
 * which matches every scoped topic on the server side (see
 * `engine/houston-engine-server/src/ws.rs`). Narrower clients (headless
 * agents, mobile) should add targeted subscribe helpers instead of using
 * the firehose so they don't waste bandwidth.
