# Auth (Supabase + Google SSO)

One-click Google sign-in on first launch. Tokens in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager — never localStorage, never disk. Identifies users in PostHog, lays the foundation for Houston Cloud.

## The flow (PKCE)

1. User clicks **Continue with Google** in `SignInScreen`.
2. Frontend calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google", options: { redirectTo: "houston://auth-callback", skipBrowserRedirect: true } })`.
3. Supabase generates a PKCE code_verifier, writes it to our Keychain-backed storage adapter, returns an auth URL.
4. Frontend opens the URL in the user's system browser via `tauriSystem.openUrl()`.
5. User completes Google consent.
6. Google redirects to Supabase → Supabase redirects to `houston://auth-callback?code=<code>`.
7. macOS delivers the URL to the running Houston via `tauri-plugin-deep-link`.
8. Rust handler in `app/src-tauri/src/auth.rs::emit_deep_link` forwards the URL on a Tauri event (`auth://deep-link`).
9. Frontend listener in `app/src/lib/auth.ts::installDeepLinkListener` extracts `code`, calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)` — Supabase reads the verifier from Keychain storage, exchanges, writes the session back.
10. `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` fires → `useSession()` re-queries → `App.tsx` dismisses `SignInScreen` → sidebar footer `UserMenu` + Settings → Account section appear.
11. PostHog: `analytics.alias(userId, { email, name })` merges the anonymous `install_id` history into the identified user.

## Keychain boundary

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Session JSON (access_token, refresh_token, user) | Keychain entry `com.houston.app.auth` / `houston-auth` |
| PKCE code verifier | Keychain entry `com.houston.app.auth` / `sb-…-auth-token-code-verifier` (Supabase-managed key) |
| Storage adapter | `app/src/lib/supabase.ts::keychainStorage` → Tauri commands `auth_get_item` / `auth_set_item` / `auth_remove_item` in `auth.rs` |
| Rust dep | `keyring = "3"` with `apple-native` + `windows-native` features |

Never touches localStorage. If Keychain is locked or unavailable, the in-memory session on the current run still works; nothing persists across launches. Degraded mode, not failure.

## Gating + offline behavior

- `isAuthConfigured()` (true when `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` baked in) is the master switch. Unconfigured builds skip auth entirely — useful for local dev without secrets.
- `App.tsx` shows a splash while `useSession()` is loading, `SignInScreen` once the session resolves to `null`, the app otherwise.
- `supabase.auth.getSession()` reads locally from Keychain — transient Supabase blips do NOT kick the user. Silent token refresh handles token TTL under the hood.
- Hard sign-out: `signOut()` in `app/src/lib/auth.ts` clears Supabase session (removes Keychain entries) and calls `analytics.reset()` so subsequent anonymous events don't attach to the prior user.

## PostHog integration

- Anonymous launch: `distinct_id = install_id` (minted in `install-id.ts`).
- Sign-in: `analytics.alias(userId, { email, name })` — merges the pre-signup history to the identified user.
- Sign-out: `analytics.reset()` — future events use a fresh anonymous `distinct_id`.

## Engine identity plumbing

- At engine spawn (`app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), Rust reads the persisted Supabase session from Keychain and passes `HOUSTON_APP_USER_ID` as an env var to the subprocess. Engine treats it as an opaque string.
- The env var is only set when the user was already signed in on a prior launch (i.e. session present at spawn time). First-run signed-in users don't get the env var until the next app restart — engine doesn't need it yet; server-side use is future work.
- `HoustonEvent` envelope does NOT carry `user_id` today — deferred until there's a server-side consumer that needs it. When that lands, wrap `HoustonEvent` in an envelope struct in `engine/houston-ui-events` rather than adding `user_id` to each variant.

## Required secrets

| Var | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project settings → Project URL | Public; baked into the bundle at build time via Vite `define` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase project settings → Project API keys → `anon` `public` | Public by design; RLS policies gate all data access |

Also in CI as GitHub Secrets.

## One-time GCP setup (human)

1. GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
2. Type: Web application
3. Authorized redirect URI: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` (from Supabase → Auth → Google → Callback URL)
4. Copy client_id + client_secret → Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google → paste + enable

## One-time Supabase setup (via Supabase MCP)

Minimal schema + trigger to auto-create a `profiles` row on user signup:

```sql
create table public.profiles (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users on delete cascade,
  email text not null,
  name text,
  avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  last_seen_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;
create policy "read own profile" on public.profiles for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "update own profile" on public.profiles for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create function public.handle_new_user() returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (user_id, email, name, avatar_url)
  values (new.id, new.email, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url');
  return new;
end; $$ language plpgsql security definer;

create trigger on_auth_user_created after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

## What's deliberately out of scope

- Apple SSO, email magic-link, phone OTP. Surface a "More sign-in options coming soon" microcopy line today; add providers later in Supabase dashboard.
- Server-side Rust emitting PostHog events directly — frontend covers Houston's event surface.
- Houston Cloud API endpoints — this is the identity foundation, not the product surface.
- Mobile (Capacitor) — Supabase JS works there too; deep-link scheme registered separately per platform.
- In-app NPS — PostHog has it built in; configure later.
- Teams / orgs, Stripe billing — future Supabase schema extensions.

## Provider CLI re-auth (Claude Code / Codex)

Separate from Houston account auth. Claude Code and Codex keep their own CLI
sessions. When those sessions expire mid-chat, `houston-terminal-manager`
classifies auth-shaped stderr/stdout (`401`, `unauthorized`, `not authenticated`,
expired OAuth/API-key messages) and `houston-agents-conversations` emits
`HoustonEvent::AuthRequired`. Desktop listens in `use-session-events.ts`, sets
`authRequired`, and `ProviderReconnectCard` renders inside chat via
`ChatPanel.afterMessages`. The card opens `claude auth login --claudeai` or
`codex login` through `/v1/providers/:name/login` and polls provider status
until the CLI reports authenticated.

Codex has one extra wrinkle: it can emit retry-shaped 401 messages while it
refreshes or reconnects, then continue successfully. Treat the synthetic
`__auth_retry__` marker as provisional. Suppress it, remember it, and emit
`AuthRequired` only if the session exits with an auth-flavored error. Terminal
401 / unauthenticated messages still emit `AuthRequired` immediately.

OpenAI provider status should prefer `codex login status` over shallow
`~/.codex/auth.json` parsing. Keep the auth-file check only as fallback for old
Codex versions or unrelated config-load failures, because config drift should
not look like sign-out.
