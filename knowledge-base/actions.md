# Actions (a.k.a. Skills)

Two names, one thing. **On disk + in code = "skill"** (matches Claude Code / industry). **In the UI + product copy = "Action"**. When the user asks the agent to "create an action", they mean a skill in `.agents/skills/`.

Why the split: skill is jargon for non-technical users. Action is a verb they instantly understand. Files keep the original name so Claude Code's auto-discovery (`.claude/skills/<name>` → `../../.agents/skills/<name>` symlink) keeps working unchanged.

## File layout

```
.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md       # source of truth, YAML frontmatter + body
.claude/skills/<slug>                # symlink → ../../.agents/skills/<slug>
                                     # auto-created by engine on `list_skills`
```

Houston Store agent packages may also include `.agents/skills/*`.
Install copies the package to `~/.houston/agents/<id>/`; creating a
workspace agent from that definition copies those packaged skills into
the user's agent root so Actions appear in chat immediately.
Store-packaged Actions must include `inputs` and `prompt_template`.
Prompt placeholders like `{company}` or `{YYYY-MM}` belong in
frontmatter as form fields, then in the template as `{{company}}` /
`{{period}}`. If an Action has no structured fields, use an optional
`request` textarea so all Store Actions follow the same form flow.

The body is a regular markdown file Claude Code uses as the procedure when the action runs. The frontmatter drives both **tool discovery** (Claude reads `name` + `description`) and **UI rendering** (everything else).

## Frontmatter schema

Source of truth: `engine/houston-skills/src/lib.rs` (`SkillSummary` + `SkillInput`). Parsed by `serde_yml`, so anything valid YAML works.

```yaml

    label: What should I focus on?
    type: textarea                 # text | textarea | select; default: text
    required: false
    default: Pricing
  - name: tone
    label: Tone
    type: select
    options: [Casual, Formal]      # required for `type: select`
    default: Casual

prompt_template: |                 # `{{var}}` placeholders match `inputs[].name`
  Research the company at {{company_url}}.
  Focus: {{focus}}
  Tone: {{tone}}

## Procedure
Step-by-step instructions Claude follows when the action runs.
```

### Field details

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| `name` | string | — | Required slug. Drives the file path + Claude's tool name. |
| `description` | string | `""` | One line. Claude semantically matches user intent against this. **Specific = reliable invocation.** |
| `version` | int | `1` | Engine increments on edit. |
| `tags` | string[] | `[]` | Free-form. Surfaced in the agent's skills tab. |
| `created` / `last_used` | string | unset | YYYY-MM-DD. Engine maintains. |
| `category` | string | unset | Picker tab grouping. Missing → falls under "Other". |
| `featured` | bool | `false` | Accepts `yes` / `true` / `1` / `on`. Surfaces on the empty-chat showcase. |
| `image` | string | unset | Either an `https://...` URL OR a Fluent 3D Emoji slug (lowercased folder name from [microsoft/fluentui-emoji/assets](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji/tree/main/assets), spaces → dashes). Resolved frontend-side via `resolveActionImage`. |
| `integrations` | string[] | `[]` | Composio toolkit slugs. Drives the small logo row on the card. |
| `inputs` | `SkillInput[]` | `[]` | Empty = action runs immediately. Non-empty = form replaces composer. |
| `prompt_template` | string | unset | YAML pipe (`|`) for multi-line. `{{name}}` placeholders interpolated against the form values. Missing template = synthesised `"Use the X skill with these inputs:\n- label: value\n..."`. |

### `SkillInput` shape

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| `name` | string | required | Variable name for `{{ }}` in `prompt_template`. |
| `label` | string | required | Shown above the field. |
| `placeholder` | string | unset | Inside the field (or "—" hint for select). |
| `type` | enum | `text` | `text` \| `textarea` \| `select`. |
| `required` | bool | `true` | Disables Start until filled. |
| `default` | string | unset | Pre-fills the field on open. |
| `options` | string[] | `[]` | Required for `type: select`. |

## Render pipeline

1. **Engine** parses SKILL.md frontmatter via `serde_yml` (`engine/houston-skills/src/format.rs`). Unknown fields are silently ignored — old skills with `icon:` / `starter_prompt:` still parse.
2. Engine returns the full `SkillSummaryResponse` (incl. `inputs`, `promptTemplate`) on `GET /v1/skills`.
3. **App** (`useSkills` query → `tauri.ts` → `engine-client`) maps the snake/camel-case wire shape back to app's `SkillSummary`.
4. **`useAgentChatPanel`** (`app/src/components/use-agent-chat-panel.tsx`) — single source of truth for the per-agent panel UX. Owns:
   - skill discovery (featured cards on empty state)
   - `ActionForm` state machine
   - composer model selector + Actions button
   - Composio link card renderer
   - file-tool result renderer
   - `renderUserMessage` — decodes the action marker into a card
5. Both **BoardTab** (per-agent kanban) and **Dashboard** (Mission Control / cross-agent kanban) consume this hook so the right panel is identical in both views.

## Action invocation marker (chat persistence)

When the user runs an action, the persisted user_message body is:

```
<!--houston:action {"skill":"research-company","displayName":"Research a company","image":"...","description":"...","integrations":["tavily"],"fields":[{"label":"Company to research","value":"https://stripe.com"}]}-->

Use the research-company skill.

Research the company at https://stripe.com.
Focus: Pricing
```

- The HTML-comment marker is inert text to Claude (it ignores it) but carries everything the chat renderer needs to draw the card. Single source of truth = single persisted body.
- Decoder lives in `@houston-ai/chat`'s `action-message.ts` so desktop AND mobile render the same card from the same payload.
- Encoder (`encodeActionMessage`) + Claude-prompt assembler (`buildActionClaudePrompt`) live in `app/src/lib/action-message.ts` — only the desktop sends actions today.

## Authoring an action via Claude

When the user asks "create an action that does X", Claude should:
1. Pick a slug (kebab-case, descriptive).
2. Write `~/.houston/workspaces/<Workspace>/<Agent>/.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` with the full frontmatter schema above.
3. Set `description` carefully — it's the trigger phrase Claude itself will use for tool matching later.
4. Default to `featured: yes` for new actions until proven otherwise (so the user actually finds them).
5. Include an `image` slug — pick a relevant Fluent 3D emoji (browse the assets folder).
6. If the user mentions inputs ("ask me for the URL", "let me pick the email provider"), declare `inputs:` and a `prompt_template:` that references them.
7. Body: at least an `## Instructions` or `## Procedure` section.

The user never sees the `name` slug — they see `displayName` (auto-derived: `humanize(name)` = `"Research company"` from `"research-company"`). Pick slugs that read well humanized.
