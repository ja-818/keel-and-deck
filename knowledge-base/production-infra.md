# Production Infrastructure

Four prod systems. All **dormant by default** — activate only when env vars set.

## Auto-updater (`tauri-plugin-updater`)

- **Config:** `tauri.conf.json` → `plugins.updater` (endpoint + pubkey)
- **Frontend:** `app/src/hooks/use-update-checker.ts` → checks on launch + every 30 min
- **UI:** `app/src/components/shell/update-checker.tsx` → update card w/ download, progress, details, relaunch
- **How:** Checks `latest.json` on GitHub Releases. Newer version? Downloads `.app.tar.gz`, verifies Ed25519 sig, replaces binary, relaunches.
- **Relaunch:** frontend captures the original app bundle path before install and calls `relaunch_app_from_path` after install. Do not use generic process relaunch after macOS updater install; it can resolve to the moved backup bundle and reopen the old version.
- **Notes:** release CI writes `release-notes.md` into `latest.json.notes`; the update card shows those details.
- **Critical:** Update signing (Ed25519 via `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`) is SEPARATE from Apple code signing. Both needed.
- **Critical:** Users who install version WITHOUT updater can never auto-update. Ship updater in EVERY release.

## Analytics (`posthog-js`)

- **Purpose:** investor-grade usage + product decisions only. Avoid broad behavioral surveillance.
- **Pure JS:** runs in webview, no Rust plugin. Avoids Tokio runtime conflicts. Works in future Capacitor mobile too.
- **Init:** `app/src/lib/analytics.ts` — reads `POSTHOG_KEY` + `POSTHOG_HOST` via Vite `define` (baked at build time). Empty key → silent no-op. PostHog `init()` runs at module load for JS exception capture; product events fire after `analytics.init()` identifies the persistent install_id.
- **PostHog config:** autocapture, pageview/pageleave, session replay, heatmaps, dead clicks, rage clicks, and feature-flag `/flags` calls are disabled in code. Enable any of these only with a specific question.
- **Install identity:** `app/src/lib/install-id.ts` — mints a UUID on first launch, persists via `tauriPreferences` (`install_id` key). Used as anonymous PostHog `distinct_id` until sign-in, then `analytics.alias/identify` merges history to the Supabase user.
- **User identity:** `distinct_id` is the stable Supabase user id. `email` and `email_domain` are PostHog person properties only, used for lookup, company-domain filtering, and B2B usage checks.
- **Debug/Release:** `import.meta.env.DEV` → `is_debug` super property. Filter it out in dashboards to exclude dev activity.
- **Super properties:** `app_version`, `os`, `install_id`, `is_debug`.
- **Privacy:** no workspace names, agent names, raw prompts, raw message text, file paths, session keys, or raw error text in PostHog event props. Email is allowed only as a person property after auth, never as an event property.

### Event surface
- **Growth:** `app_active` (once per install per UTC day), `install_created`
- **Activation:** `workspace_created`, `provider_configured`, `agent_created`, `chat_message_sent`, `chat_message_received`
- **Engagement:** `mission_created`
- **Reliability:** `session_failed`, `app_error_shown`, PostHog `$exception` from JS global handlers + React error boundary

**Activation milestone:** `chat_message_received` — user sent a message and got a reply. Configure as the activation event in PostHog; all retention/funnel insights key off it.

### Adding event
```typescript
import { analytics } from "@/lib/analytics";
analytics.track("event_name");
```
Event names + props are allowlisted in `AnalyticsEventName` / `AnalyticsProperty`. Add only if tied to a dashboard question. Fire-and-forget. Never throws/blocks. Not configured → silent no-op.

**Analytics in `app/` only** — never in `ui/`. Library boundary rule applies.

### PostHog dashboards
Create one dashboard: **Houston Growth + Reliability**. Every tile filters `is_debug != true`.

1. **DAU:** unique users, event `app_active`, interval day
2. **WAU:** unique users, event `app_active`, interval week
3. **MAU:** unique users, event `app_active`, interval month
4. **Activation funnel:** `install_created` → `workspace_created` → `provider_configured` → `agent_created` → `chat_message_sent` → `chat_message_received`
5. **Activated retention:** weekly retention where start + return event = `chat_message_received`
6. **Engaged users:** unique users with `mission_created` or `chat_message_received`
7. **Reliability:** count of `session_failed` + `$exception`, broken down by `error_kind`
8. **Company domains:** active users broken down by person property `email_domain`

Do NOT use raw autocapture event lists for product decisions. If a question needs click-level data, prefer one temporary, named event and delete it after the decision.

### BigQuery export (optional)
PostHog → BigQuery plugin → target GCP project (burns credits). SQL-queryable event history forever, immune to PostHog retention limits. Useful for investor-update analytics.

## Auth (`@supabase/supabase-js` + Google SSO)

- **Session storage:** CI releases use macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager via the `keyring` crate (`app/src-tauri/src/auth.rs`). Local builds use browser storage scoped per worktree to avoid macOS Keychain prompts from changing local signatures. Override with `HOUSTON_AUTH_STORAGE=keychain` or `HOUSTON_AUTH_STORAGE=browser`.
- **Flow:** One-click Google sign-in → system browser → OAuth redirect to `houston://auth-callback` → `tauri-plugin-deep-link` forwards to frontend → Supabase PKCE exchange → session persisted in configured auth storage. Full diagram + code pointers: `knowledge-base/auth.md`.
- **Gating:** `isAuthConfigured()` checks whether `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are baked in. Unconfigured builds skip the sign-in screen entirely.
- **PostHog merge:** On sign-in, `analytics.alias(userId, { email })` merges anonymous install_id history to the identified user and sets `email` / `email_domain` person properties; on sign-out, `analytics.reset()` returns to anonymous.

## Crash reporting (`sentry` + `tauri-plugin-sentry`)

- **Backend:** Initialized in `lib.rs` BEFORE other plugins. Conditional on `option_env!("SENTRY_DSN")`.
- **Frontend:** Auto-injected by `tauri-plugin-sentry`. Catches JS errors + unhandled promise rejections. Zero frontend code.
- **Rust panics:** Captured via sentry panic handler.
- **Check:** User reports crash or weird behavior → Sentry dashboard BEFORE local logs.

## In-app bug reports (Linear issue creation)

- **Frontend:** `app/src/lib/error-toast.ts` shows the "Report bug" action. `app/src/lib/bug-report.ts` sends a provider-neutral bug report object with recent frontend + backend logs.
- **Native delivery:** `app/src-tauri/src/bug_report/` creates a Linear issue with `reqwest` against `https://api.linear.app/graphql`. Do not post from the webview; the Linear API key does not belong in the JS bundle.
- **Config:** `LINEAR_API_KEY` + `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` are read from runtime env, `app/.env.local`, `app/src-tauri/.env.local`, and `option_env!()` for release builds. CI passes them in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Release builds embed the key in the native app, so never use a broad Linear key. Use a key restricted to "Create issues" and the target team only. Bug reports look up and apply the `User Bug` label; override with optional `LINEAR_BUG_LABEL_NAME`.
- **Local smoke:** `cd app/src-tauri && LINEAR_API_KEY=... LINEAR_TEAM_ID=... cargo test creates_real_linear_issue_when_env_is_set -- --ignored` creates one real Linear issue.

## Required env vars

Shell (local builds) AND GitHub Secrets (CI):

| Var | Purpose | Source |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Developer ID | Apple Developer portal → Certificates |
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | App Store Connect key ID | ASC → Users → Keys |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` | Path to `.p8` key | Downloaded when creating key |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | ASC issuer UUID | ASC → Users → Keys |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Ed25519 key for update signing | `pnpm tauri signer generate` |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for above | Set during gen |
| `POSTHOG_KEY` | PostHog project API key (client-side, public-safe) | PostHog → Project settings → Project API key |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | PostHog ingest host | `https://us.i.posthog.com` (or EU equivalent) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL | Supabase → Project settings → API → Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key (public-safe, RLS-gated) | Supabase → Project settings → API → Project API keys → `anon` `public` |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Create in-app bug-report issues | Linear → Settings → Account → Security & Access → Personal API keys |
| `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` | Target team for in-app bug-report issues | Linear command menu → Copy model UUID on the target team |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Crash reporting DSN | sentry.io project settings |

CI also needs as Secrets:
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` — base64 `.p12`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` — password for `.p12`

**Never hardcode.** Read via `option_env!()` in Rust (compile-time). Pass as env vars in CI.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Trigger:** Push tag matching `v*`
- **Output:** Draft GitHub Release w/ signed+notarized DMG + signed MSI + `latest.json`
- **Duration:** ~25-30 min wall-clock (mac + win run in parallel; mac is the long pole at ~25 min including Apple notarization).
- **Draft = QA gate.** Users don't see until published on GitHub.

### Job graph
```
prep (ubuntu, ~30s)               creates empty draft + release-notes.md artifact
  ├── build-macos (mac, ~25m)     builds, signs, notarizes, uploads DMG/tar/sig/latest.json
  └── build-windows (win, ~20m)   builds, uploads MSI + .sig
        └── finalize (ubuntu, ~30s) extends latest.json with windows-x86_64 entry, posts Slack
```
Mac and Windows run in parallel because they only need the empty draft `prep` creates, not each other's output. `finalize` stitches `latest.json` together (the macOS-only base from build-macos plus the Windows entry assembled from the MSI .sig in the draft) and posts the team Slack notification. Slack lives in `finalize` (not Windows) because it needs `release-notes.md` and the file is published as a workflow artifact by `prep`.

## macOS Universal (arm64 + Intel)

Houston ships ONE DMG that runs natively on Apple Silicon AND Intel. Same app, same download, same update channel.

### How it works
- `release.yml` builds `houston-engine` TWICE — once per real triple (`aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`).
- `build.rs` stages both as per-triple sidecars: `src-tauri/binaries/houston-engine-aarch64-apple-darwin` + `-x86_64-apple-darwin`. Tauri universal build requires per-triple sidecars (NOT a pre-lipo'd fat binary).
- `tauri-action` invoked with `--target universal-apple-darwin`. It runs cargo twice, then `lipo`s the outputs into one fat `.app`. Bundle lands at `target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/`.
- Verification step runs `lipo -info` on the embedded engine sidecar and fails the release if either slice is missing.
- `latest.json` ships FOUR platform keys (`darwin-aarch64`, `darwin-aarch64-app`, `darwin-x86_64`, `darwin-x86_64-app`) all pointing at the same tarball + signature. Intel users on older Houston installs check `darwin-x86_64` — if that key is absent they NEVER see the update prompt.
- `bundle.macOS.minimumSystemVersion = 10.15` in `tauri.conf.json` — required for Intel Macs old enough to matter.

### Engine-only release
`.github/workflows/engine-release.yml` (tag `engine-v*`) builds `houston-engine` standalone for Linux (arm64 + x86_64 musl) and macOS (arm64 + Intel). Four artifacts total.

### Local universal build
```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin -p houston-engine-server
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin -p houston-engine-server
cd app && pnpm tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin
```
Output: `target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/{macos,dmg}/`.

### Dev is single-arch
`pnpm tauri dev` stays single-triple (whatever the host is). `build.rs` falls back to `target/release/` when a per-triple path is missing, so nothing breaks.

### Do NOT break Intel without warning
Removing an arch from `release.yml` (or dropping `darwin-x86_64*` keys from `latest.json`) strands every Intel user silently. Migrate with a deprecation release first.
