## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Spaces** — top-level organizational container (replaces "Organization"). Space switcher in sidebar, CRUD commands in Rust, `useSpaceStore` in frontend
- **Dashboard view** — grid overview of all workspaces in current space
- **Connections view** — space-scoped channel and service management
- **Per-task Claude sessions** — each kanban card is a Claude conversation with its own session and chat history
- **Kanban column `onAdd` button** — "+" button in column headers for creating tasks directly from the board
- **New conversation panel** — dedicated panel for starting conversations on tasks
- **ChatSidebar** — progress tracking sidebar showing step checklist + channels list, moved to `@houston-ai/chat`
- **ProgressPanel** — step-by-step agent progress checklist alongside chat
- **`.houston/prompts/` convention** — editable system prompt components (`system.md`, `self-improvement.md`)
- **Context tab** — editable CLAUDE.md + prompt files in the workspace
- **Welcome screen** — first-launch onboarding to create initial space

### Changed
- Renamed "Organization" to "Space" across app, stores, and Rust commands
- Standardized sidebar layout: Space switcher + Dashboard + Connections + AI Workspaces
- Extended `AppSidebar` to support workspace management (rename, delete, create)
- Sidebar width now persists via preferences
- All Tauri invoke parameter names use `snake_case` to match Rust
- All Tauri command errors surface as toasts (no silent failures)

### Fixed

- Empty states for all tabs
- Preference commands (serde camelCase alignment)
