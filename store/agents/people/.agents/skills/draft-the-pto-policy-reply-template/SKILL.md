  Draft the PTO policy reply template. Use the answer-policy-question skill. Read the PTO section of the policy canon from context/people-context.md, then draft three reply variants: (a) direct yes when the ask is clearly inside policy, (b) ambiguous follow-up when I need more context, (c) escalation note when the ask exceeds policy. Write to approvals/pto-reply-template.md for reuse.
