# Triage an inbound ticket against your routing rules
**Use when:** Category, priority, VIP-flag, SLA  -  before you read it.
**What it does:** I pull the thread via your connected inbox (Gmail / Outlook / Intercom / Help Scout / Zendesk), classify against your routing rules, assign priority from tier + content signals, and VIP-flag. Writes to `conversations.json` + `conversations/{id}/thread.json`.
**Outcome:** Triaged entry at `conversations.json`  -  ready for `draft-reply` or `detect-signal`.
## Instructions
Run this as a user-facing action. Use the underlying `triage-incoming` skill for the deep procedure.
Ask the user for any missing specifics, then complete the work end-to-end.
