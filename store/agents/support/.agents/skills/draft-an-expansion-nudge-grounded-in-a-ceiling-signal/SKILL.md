# Draft an expansion nudge grounded in a ceiling signal
**Use when:** Real signal or I stop  -  no upsell spam.
**What it does:** I check `health-scores.json` for a real ceiling signal first. If found, I draft a short, specific outreach naming the signal. If not, I stop  -  no upsell pressure.
**Outcome:** Draft at `expansions/{account}.md`  -  or a clear 'no signal, don't push.'
## Instructions
Run this as a user-facing action. Use the underlying `draft-lifecycle-message` skill for the deep procedure.
Ask the user for any missing specifics, then complete the work end-to-end.
