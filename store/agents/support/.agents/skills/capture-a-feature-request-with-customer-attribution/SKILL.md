**Use when:** Dedupes into existing asks; VIPs flagged.
**What it does:** I extract the ask in one sentence, attribute to the requesting customer's slug, and dedupe into `requests.json`. VIP requesters get flagged.
**Outcome:** Entry in `requests.json`  -  surfaces in weekly reviews + 'broadcast shipped.'
