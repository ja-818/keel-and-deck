# What's breaching SLA right now
**Use when:** Within 2h of breach or already past  -  next action each.
**What it does:** I filter `conversations.json` to open items within 2h of breach or already past, read SLA tiers from your support context, and list customer + tier + time left + next action.
**Outcome:** Report at `sla-reports/{date}.md`  -  hit the red ones first.
## Instructions
Run this as a user-facing action. Use the underlying `scan-inbox` skill for the deep procedure.
