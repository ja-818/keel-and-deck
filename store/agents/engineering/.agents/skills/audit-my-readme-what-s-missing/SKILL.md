# Audit my README  -  what's missing?
**Use when:** Checklist score + rewritten lede + prioritized fixes.
**What it does:** I fetch your repo's README, score against a standard checklist, write inline diff suggestions + a rewritten lede, and produce a prioritized fix list. Never auto-commits.
**Outcome:** An audit at audits/readme-{repo}-{date}.md with a rewritten lede and inline diffs.
## Instructions
Run this as a user-facing action. Use the underlying `audit` skill for the deep procedure.
Ask the user for any missing specifics, then complete the work end-to-end.
