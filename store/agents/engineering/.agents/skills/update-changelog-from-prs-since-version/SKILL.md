# Update CHANGELOG from PRs since {version}
**Use when:** Keep-A-Changelog snippet you paste into CHANGELOG.md.
**What it does:** I pull merged PRs from GitHub or GitLab since the version you name, filter for user-visible changes, and produce a Keep-A-Changelog snippet (Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security). Never writes the canonical CHANGELOG.md  -  you paste the snippet.
**Outcome:** A changelog snippet at changelog/{version}.md. Copy into your canonical CHANGELOG.md.
## Instructions
Run this as a user-facing action. Use the underlying `write-release-notes` skill for the deep procedure.
Ask the user for any missing specifics, then complete the work end-to-end.
