  Audit our local dev experience. Use the audit skill with surface=devx. Read README + CONTRIBUTING + Makefile + package.json scripts + docker-compose + .env.example + CI config via the connected code host. Count discrete setup steps, estimate setup time, estimate build time from CI history, and surface the top 5 paper cuts (missing env vars, flaky scripts, bad error messages, outdated commands) with suggested fixes + effort. Save to audits/devx-{{repo}}-{{date}}.md.
