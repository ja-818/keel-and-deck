  Run the weekly PR health readout. Use the analyze skill with subject=pr-velocity. Pull the last 7 days of PRs from my connected GitHub / GitLab. Compute: PRs merged, median cycle time (open → merge), largest PR size in lines changed, reviewer concentration (top-reviewer share), open-to-merge age of currently-open PRs. Read context/engineering-context.md so the diagnosis respects quality bar + cadence. Save to pr-velocity/{{week}}.md with a one-line diagnosis per anomaly.
