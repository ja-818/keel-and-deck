# Handle Objection

Single-objection handler. Two outputs: in-call reframe (short, verbal) + post-call follow-up email (short, written).

## When to use

- "they said '{objection}' on the {deal} call  -  draft my reframe".
- "how do I handle '{objection}'".
- Called by `analyze subject=discovery-call` for any OBJECTION surfaced in call.

## Steps

1. **Read the playbook.** Load `context/sales-context.md`. Find matching entry in Objection handbook. If playbook missing, ask user to run `define-playbook` first, stop.

2. **Read the ledger.** Load `config/context-ledger.json`. `universal.icp` field grounds reframe; progressive captures there may supersede playbook's initial objection list.

3. **Check recent call-insights**  -  read `call-insights/*.md` (top 3 most recent) for pattern touching this objection. Prefer verbatim successful reframes from past calls.

4. **Draft the in-call reframe (3 sentences):**

   1. **Acknowledge**  -  no backpedal, no dismiss.
   2. **Reframe** with concrete customer example or data point (use anchor accounts from `context/sales-context.md`).
   3. **Propose next step**  -  specific, time-boxed.

5. **Draft the post-call follow-up email**  -  5–8 lines:

   - Subject: "Re: {their pain, in their words}"
   - Open: confirm heard them.
   - 2–3 bullets: facts/proof addressing specific objection.
   - Close: concrete next step + date.

   Match voice from `config/voice.md` (or capture samples on first run if missing).

6. **Write atomically** to `deals/{slug}/objections/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md.tmp` → rename. Structure: objection (verbatim) · reframe (3 lines) · follow-up email (body) · sources (playbook + calls referenced).

7. **Update the ledger**  -  if objection surfaced new variant, append to `universal.icp.pains` via atomic read-merge-write of `config/context-ledger.json`.

8. **Append to `outputs.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "id": "<uuid v4>",
     "type": "objection",
     "title": "Objection  -  {objection short}",
     "summary": "<reframe first line + follow-up CTA>",
     "path": "deals/{slug}/objections/{date}-{slug}.md",
     "status": "draft",
     "createdAt": "<ISO>",
     "updatedAt": "<ISO>"
   }
   ```

9. **Summarize.** Print 3-sentence reframe inline so user can use verbally on next touch. Path to full artifact.

## Outputs

- `deals/{slug}/objections/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`
- Possibly updates `config/context-ledger.json`.
- Appends to `outputs.json` with `domain: "meetings"`, type `objection-reframe`.
