# Reframe an objection  -  3 sentences + followup
**Use when:** Acknowledge → reframe → specific next step.
**What it does:** I draft a 3-sentence in-call reframe (acknowledge → reframe with concrete anchor-account example → propose dated next step) plus a short follow-up email grounded in the playbook's objection handbook.
**Outcome:** Reframe at deals/{slug}/objections/{date}-{slug}.md  -  use the 3-sentence version live on the next touch.
## Instructions
