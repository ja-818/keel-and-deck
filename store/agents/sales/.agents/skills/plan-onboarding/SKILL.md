# Plan Onboarding

First artifact post-close. Sets success metric explicit so health score honest against it next year.

## When to use

- "plan the onboarding for {customer}".
- "kickoff plan for {customer}".
- Post-close trigger when close-plan status flips `closed-won`.

## Steps

1. **Read the playbook.** `context/sales-context.md`.

2. **Read this agent's close-plan + proposal.** `deals/{slug}/
   close-plan.md` and `proposal-v*.md` (latest). Extract: customer
   problem, their success metric (verbatim), champion, economic
   buyer, stakeholders, timeline.

3. **Read config/success-metric.json**  -  our canonical framing.
   Cross-reference vs THEIR metric. Flag divergence.

4. **Draft onboarding plan:**

   1. **Kickoff agenda**  -  5–7 items, 60 min. Intros, success metric
      confirmation (we restate, THEY confirm verbally), access /
      provisioning, team handoff, cadence.
   2. **Success metric (explicit)**  -  both versions: ours + theirs.
      If diverge, state which one drives first-90 health score.
   3. **90-day time-to-value timeline:**
      - Day 0  -  kickoff.
      - Day 7  -  access + first use.
      - Day 14  -  first value milestone (concrete, measurable).
      - Day 30  -  first outcome review.
      - Day 60  -  mid-term adjustment.
      - Day 90  -  first quarterly outcome.
   4. **Champions + blockers**  -  named. Execs to introduce.
   5. **First-30-day risk list**  -  anything visible that could
      derail.

5. **Write atomically** to `customers/{slug}/onboarding.md.tmp` →
   rename. Create `customers/{slug}/` if missing.

6. **Create row in `customers.json`**  -  `health: "GREEN"`,
   `startedAt: <ISO>`, `renewalAt` = kickoff + term, etc.

7. **Append to `outputs.json`** with `type: "onboarding"`.

8. **Summarize.** Explicit success metric + 30-day milestone.

## Outputs

- `customers/{slug}/onboarding.md`
- New row in `customers.json`.
- Appends to `outputs.json`.
