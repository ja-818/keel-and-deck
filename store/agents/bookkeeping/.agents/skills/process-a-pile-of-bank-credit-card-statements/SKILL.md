  Process these statements. Use the process-statements skill. Extract every transaction from the attached PDFs (parallel Haiku extractors, one per PDF), canonicalize parties, categorize against the locked chart-of-accounts (Sonnet categorizers, one per account), then assemble a Google Sheets workbook with a formula-driven P&L (Sonnet sheets writer). Save the run artifact to runs/{{period}}/run.json and log to outputs.json. Credit card sign convention: purchases are negative. P&L totals are =SUMIFS formulas, never hardcoded.

**Use when:** PDFs → categorized transactions → live Google Sheets P&L.
**What it does:** The full pipeline. PDFs → parallel extractors (Haiku) → categorizers (Sonnet) → Google Sheets workbook with a formula-driven P&L. Low-confidence items go to Suspense, never invented GL codes.
**Outcome:** Live Google Sheet URL + run.json at runs/{period}/ + suspense flagged prominently.
## Instructions
