  Respond to the audit / DD request. Use the audit-books skill with mode=audit-response. Parse the request into discrete items. For sample-selection requests, pull a random sample of the right size from the relevant population (with seed documented for reproducibility). For walkthrough requests, summarize the process flow from context/bookkeeping-context.md. For document requests, assemble the docs into handoffs/audit-{{quarter}}/{{request_slug}}/. Flag any request that touches an area with a judgment call  -  surface the options, you decide.
