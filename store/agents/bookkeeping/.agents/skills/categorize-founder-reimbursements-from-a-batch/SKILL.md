  Process the founder-reimbursement batch. Use the handle-expense-receipt skill in BATCH sub-mode. For each attached receipt or line item: extract vendor + date + amount, categorize against the locked CoA (confidence ≥ 0.90  -  Suspense otherwise), draft one line per expense. At the end, draft a single credit JE: debit each expense line, credit Founder Loan Payable (or Accrued Reimbursements if same-period reimbursement). Save individual expense records to expenses/ and the summary JE to journal-entries/{{period}}/founder-reimbursement-{{date}}.md.
