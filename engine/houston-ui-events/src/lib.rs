//! Event types emitted from the Rust backend to the UI via Tauri's event bus.
//!
//! Every variant is a message the frontend reacts to (feed updates, status
//! changes, toasts, file-change notifications for query invalidation, etc.).
//! Emit via `app_handle.emit("houston-event", HoustonEvent::...)`.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally a tiny leaf — no Tauri dep, just the wire
//! contract — so any backend crate can construct events without pulling in
//! the full Tauri framework.
