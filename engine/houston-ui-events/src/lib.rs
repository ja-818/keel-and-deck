//! Event types emitted from the Rust backend to the UI.
//!
//! Every variant is a message the frontend reacts to (feed updates, status
//! changes, toasts, file-change notifications for query invalidation, etc.).
//!
//! This crate is transport-neutral. Producers construct `HoustonEvent`
//! variants and hand them to an `EventSink` — the concrete sink (Tauri
//! emit, broadcast channel for the HTTP server, no-op for tests) is
//! injected at the top of the app. No Tauri dep here by design.
