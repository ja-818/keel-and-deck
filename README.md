## What is this?

**Houston** is an AI work delegation desktop app and framework for building AI agent experiences. It includes 10 React packages with 100+ components, Rust crates for session management and workspace persistence, and the Houston app itself — a Tauri 2 desktop app where you create AI workspaces, delegate tasks to Claude, and track progress on a kanban board.

Files-first architecture: agent-visible data lives in `.houston/` workspace files (JSON + markdown), not in a database. Agents read and write files naturally. The only SQL is for chat conversation replay.

Built with Tauri 2, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion.

---

## Quick Start

### Run the Houston App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ja-818/houston.git
cd houston
pnpm install
cd app && pnpm tauri dev
```

On first launch, create a space and workspace. Pick an experience (Project Manager, Research Agent, Code Reviewer, etc.) and start chatting with Claude.

### Build Your Own Experience

```bash
npx create-houston-experience my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

You get a working app with Chat + CLAUDE.md editor out of the box. Add @houston-ai components as you need them.

---

## How the App Works

Houston organizes work into **Spaces** and **Workspaces**:

- **Space** — top-level container (like a team or project group). Each space has its own connections and workspaces.
- **Workspace** — an AI agent workspace powered by an experience. Each workspace has a chat, optional kanban board, skills, files, and more.
- **Experience** — defines what tabs and capabilities a workspace has. Pick from built-in experiences or build your own.

```
Space ("Personal")
  +-- Workspace ("Research Agent")    <- experience: Research Agent
  |     Chat | Files | Skills
  +-- Workspace ("Project Manager")   <- experience: Project Manager
  |     Chat | Tasks | Context | Skills
  +-- Workspace ("Code Reviewer")     <- experience: Code Reviewer
        Chat | Files | Skills
```

Each kanban card is a Claude conversation. Click a task to see its full chat history. The agent's progress shows as a step-by-step checklist alongside the chat.

---

## Experience System

Experiences are JSON manifests that define what an AI workspace looks like. Three tiers:

| Tier | What you write | What you get |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **JSON-only** | `manifest.json` | Tabs, prompt, colors, icon — uses built-in components |
| **Custom React** | `manifest.json` + `bundle.js` | Custom React components (import @houston-ai as peer deps) |
| **Custom Rust** | PR a new crate | Declare `features: ["capability"]` in manifest |

### Manifest

```json
{
  "id": "project-manager",
  "name": "Project Manager",
  "description": "AI project manager that breaks down work and tracks progress",
  "icon": "LayoutGrid",
  "tabs": [
    { "id": "chat", "label": "Chat", "builtIn": "chat" },
    { "id": "tasks", "label": "Tasks", "builtIn": "board" },
    { "id": "context", "label": "Context", "builtIn": "context" },
    { "id": "skills", "label": "Skills", "builtIn": "skills" }
  ],
  "defaultTab": "tasks",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a project manager...",
  "claudeMd": "# Project Manager\n..."
}
```

**Built-in tab types:** `chat`, `board`, `skills`, `files`, `connections`, `context`, `routines`, `channels`, `events`, `learnings`

**9 built-in experiences:** Default, Project Manager, Meeting Assistant, Research Agent, Data Analyst, Code Reviewer, DevOps, Content Writer, Customer Support.

**Installed experiences** load from `~/.houston/experiences/{id}/manifest.json`.

---

## Workspace Convention

Every Houston workspace stores agent-visible data in a `.houston/` folder:

```
~/Documents/Houston/{SpaceName}/{WorkspaceName}/
  .houston/
    workspace.json      # Workspace metadata (id, experience, timestamps)
    tasks.json          # Kanban board items
    routines.json       # Recurring schedules
    goals.json          # High-level objectives
    channels.json       # Messaging integrations (Telegram, Slack)
    skills/             # Agent skill instructions
      research.md       #   ## Instructions + ## Learnings
    prompts/            # Editable system prompt components
      system.md         #   Base system prompt
      self-improvement.md
    log.jsonl           # Session audit trail
    config.json         # Project settings (model, effort)
  CLAUDE.md             # Agent instructions
```

**The rule:** if `@houston-ai` has a component that renders it, the data lives in `.houston/`. App-specific files go in their own folder.

Agents interact with these files directly — no CLI intermediary, no SQL queries. The `workspace_store` module provides typed CRUD with atomic writes.

```

**Houston UI** components are props-driven with no store lock-in. Use Zustand, Redux, Jotai — whatever you want.

**Houston** handles session lifecycle, workspace file management, and channel routing. Agent-visible data lives in `.houston/` files. SQLite is only for chat conversation replay.

## Theming

Everything is controlled by CSS variables:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #0d0d0d;           /* Near-black (default) */
  --color-primary-foreground: #ffffff;
  --color-secondary: #f9f9f9;
  --color-muted-foreground: #5d5d5d;
  --color-border: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
}
```

Override `--color-primary` for brand theming. All components pick it up automatically.
