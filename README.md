## What Houston is

**For everyone** — a free desktop app with AI agents that do real work. Bookkeeping, outreach, research, scheduling. Install agents from the store and start working. No terminal. No prompt engineering.

**For founders** — the platform where you build AI-native products for your customers. Define your agents, Houston handles the workspace, the chat, the board, the integrations. You bring the domain expertise. [Read more](https://gethouston.ai/startups/).

> **Read the vision:** [Ship the impossible](https://gethouston.ai/vision/)

## Quick start

### Run the Houston app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethouston/houston.git
cd houston
pnpm install
cd app && pnpm tauri dev
```

### Build your first agent

Create two files:

**houston.json**
```json
{
  "id": "bookkeeper",
  "name": "Bookkeeper",
  "description": "Categorize expenses and reconcile accounts.",
  "icon": "Calculator",
  "category": "business",
  "tabs": [
    { "id": "board", "label": "Tasks", "builtIn": "board", "badge": "activity" },
    { "id": "files", "label": "Files", "builtIn": "files" },
    { "id": "job-description", "label": "Instructions", "builtIn": "job-description" }
  ]
}
```

**CLAUDE.md**
```markdown
# Bookkeeper

You categorize transactions, reconcile accounts, and flag anomalies.
Ask which period the user wants before starting.
```

Push to GitHub. In Houston, click **New Agent > GitHub**, paste your repo URL. Done.

The [Learn guide](https://gethouston.ai/learn/) covers the full details in five short chapters.

### Share a workspace template

Bundle multiple agents into one repo:

```
my-workspace/
├── workspace.json
└── agents/
    ├── bookkeeper/
    │   ├── houston.json
    │   └── CLAUDE.md
    └── tax-reviewer/
        ├── houston.json
        └── CLAUDE.md
```

**workspace.json**
```json
{
  "name": "Tax Practice",
  "description": "A complete workspace for tax professionals.",
  "agents": ["bookkeeper", "tax-reviewer"]
}
```

In Houston, click **New Workspace > Import from GitHub**, paste the repo URL. Houston creates the workspace with all agents ready to use.

---

## How the app works

Houston organizes work into **Workspaces** and **Agents**:

- **Workspace** — a group of agents (like a team or project).
- **Agent** — an AI agent instance. Chat, kanban board, skills, files, integrations.
- **Agent Definition** — a `houston.json` that defines what an agent looks like and does.

```
Workspace ("Tax Practice")
  ├── Agent ("Bookkeeper")         ← board, files, instructions
  ├── Agent ("Document Reviewer")  ← board, files, integrations
  └── Agent ("Client Comms")       ← board, files, integrations
```

Each kanban card is a Claude conversation. Click a card to see the full chat. Connect Slack and the same conversation becomes a thread.

---

## Agent definitions

Three tiers:

| Tier | What you write | What you get |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **JSON-only** | `houston.json` + `CLAUDE.md` | Tabs, prompt, icon. Uses built-in components. |
| **Custom React** | Add `bundle.js` | Custom React components as tabs. |
| **Workspace template** | `workspace.json` + agents folder | Multiple agents, one import. |

**Built-in tab types:** `board`, `files`, `job-description`, `integrations`, `routines`, `configure`, `events`

## Monorepo layout

Organized as **6 end-user products + 3 code libraries**.

## Build on Houston Engine (custom frontends)

The engine is frontend-agnostic. You don't have to ship inside the
Houston App — any web or native runtime can drive it over HTTP +
WebSocket using [`@houston-ai/engine-client`](ui/engine-client/).

**Working example: [SmartBooks](examples/smartbooks/)** — a
bookkeeping product with its own brand, its own UX, and zero
`@houston-ai/*` UI deps. ~400 lines of TSX, one npm package, renders
a live transactions table + a multi-sheet Excel workpaper. Soft
workflow: the user asks for a new column, Claude edits the Python
script, every future upload picks up the change. Clone it, rename
things, ship your own AI-native product.

```bash
cd examples/smartbooks
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Full walkthrough + architecture diagram + custom-frontend gotchas in
[examples/smartbooks/README.md](examples/smartbooks/README.md).
