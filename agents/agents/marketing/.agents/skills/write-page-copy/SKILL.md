# Write Page Copy

One skill, every copy surface on site + in product. `surface` param picks shape. Positioning, voice, no invented quotes, no promised lift % shared across.

## Parameter: `surface`

- `homepage` | `pricing` | `about` | `landing` — full page rewrite: sections, headlines, bodies, CTAs, social-proof placement.
- `signup-flow` — pre-signup page copy + email field + password rules + verification screen + first-screen post-signup. Field-level verdicts (keep / merge / defer / kill).
- `onboarding` — in-product welcome, empty states, tooltips, nudges, checklist, aha-confirmation.
- `paywall` — upgrade modal / trial-expiration / feature-gate: timing audit first, then headline + value stack + plan comparison + price anchoring + CTA + social proof + dismissal.
- `popup` — exit / scroll / time-on-page interrupt: hook, offer, dismiss/accept CTAs + trigger + targeting + frequency cap + success metric.

If user names surface plain English, infer. If ambiguous, ask ONE question naming 8 options.

## When to use

- Explicit: "rewrite my {homepage / pricing / about / landing page at URL}", "signup flow review", "in-app onboarding copy", "upgrade paywall", "exit popup".
- Implicit: after `audit` (landing-page / form / site-seo) where next step = full rewrite, not just fix list.

## Ledger fields I read

Reads `config/context-ledger.json` first.

- `company` — name, pitch30s.
- `voice` — summary + samples; ask ONE question if missing.
- `positioning` — from `context/marketing-context.md`. If missing, ask: "want me to draft your positioning first? (one skill, ~5m)" and stop.
- `icp` — roles, pains, triggers (ground benefit copy in real customer language).
- `domains.copy.primaryConversion` — one action surface must drive. If missing for public-page surface, ask ONE question: "What's the primary conversion for this page?"

## Steps

1. **Read ledger + positioning.** Gather missing required fields per above (ONE question each, best-modality first). Write atomically.
2. **Fetch current state.** URL-reachable surfaces: run `composio search web-scrape` and execute by slug (Firecrawl / ScrapingBee / equivalent) to pull rendered HTML + visible text + primary image URLs + current CTA. In-product surfaces (onboarding / some paywalls / popups): accept screenshots, Loom, or pasted copy. Nothing usable → ask for paste, stop.
3. **Source real customer language.**
   - Try recent `analyses/` or `audits/` artifacts in this agent for prior mined quotes.
   - Else run `composio search` for review-scrape providers (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Reddit, App Store), pull verbatim phrases. Nothing available → ask user for 3-5 quotes, stop. Never invent quotes.
4. **Branch on surface.**
   - `homepage` | `pricing` | `about` | `landing`: enumerate sections to rewrite (hero headline + subhead → social-proof slot → 3-5 value props tied to ICP pains → how-it-works → objections (from positioning) → final CTA recap). Per section: **Current** (quoted verbatim) → **Proposed** (founder's voice) → **Why** (principle + ICP pain + positioning claim). Give 2-3 options for hero headline + primary CTA with "ship this first" flag. Flag any current-page claim contradicting positioning in "Flagged" section (do NOT rewrite positioning — `define-positioning` owns that).
   - `signup-flow`: map flow as enumerated step list (entry → landing → email/SSO → verification → plan → password → org → billing). Mark conversion-event step. Per step: **Necessity** (keep / merge / defer / kill), **Friction** (cognitive-load / missing-value / error-shame / etc.), **Drop triggers**, full **Copy rewrites** (headline, subhead, labels, CTA, errors, confirmation). Call out what should defer post-conversion. Finish with one consolidated top-to-bottom end-state flow + top-3 ship-this-week + current vs. recommended step count.
   - `onboarding`: name aha-moment (ask if not obvious). Map surfaces: welcome screen → empty states → onboarding checklist (3-5 items, verb + outcome, ordered by aha-adjacency) → tooltips → aha-moment confirmation. Each surface: **Current / Proposed / Why** with principle named (value-first, single-next-action, action-led-label, aha-adjacency, empty-state-promise). Flag sequencing issues when data belongs in signup-flow instead (or vice versa).
   - `paywall`: **Audit timing FIRST** — user hit aha before this fires? Trigger behavioral or temporal? Dismissal gentle or punishing? Timing broken → call it as first issue. Then audit content — headline (value of upgrading, not limitation of free), plan comparison (one recommended, outcome-led names), objection handling (from positioning), social-proof placement, primary CTA (action + outcome), dismissal pattern. Flag compliance / trust issues (auto-renew, cancel policy, trial-to-paid default).
   - `popup`: clarify job in ONE question if unclear (lead capture / announcement / cart-abandon / promo / survey / reminder). Draft full spec: **Trigger** (exit-intent / scroll-% / time / behavioral — respect minimum engagement), **Targeting** (page / visitor / device / time rules), **Frequency cap** (default once-per-user for anything above banner), **Copy** (<10-word headline grounded in named quote, subhead, minimal fields, CTA with action + outcome, non-shaming dismiss, trust line only if policy-backed), **Success metric + guardrail**. Name any anti-patterns (fires-before-earned, no-dismiss, forced-scroll, guilt-close).
5. **Write** atomically to `page-copy/{surface}-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (`*.tmp` → rename). Front-matter: `surface`, `url` (if applicable), `primaryConversion`.
6. **Append to `outputs.json`.** Read-merge-write atomically: `{ id (uuid v4), type: "page-copy", title, summary, path, status: "draft", createdAt, updatedAt }`.
7. **Summarize to user.** Single highest-leverage change, top-3 ship-this-week changes, path to full file. For `paywall`, lead with timing verdict. For `signup-flow`, lead with step-count delta.

## What I never do

- Ship copy live. Drafts only — you paste / deploy.
- Invent customer quotes, stats, testimonials. Mark TBD.
- Rewrite positioning — flag contradictions; `define-positioning` owns doc.
- Promise lift %. Every variant = hypothesis.
- Add dark patterns (fake scarcity, forced scroll, guilt dismiss, shame language).

## Outputs

- `page-copy/{surface}-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Appends entry to `outputs.json` with type `page-copy`.
