//! # houston-channels
//!
//! A generic channel adapter system for messaging platforms.
//!
//! This crate provides a [`Channel`] trait that abstracts over different
//! messaging platforms (Slack, Telegram, etc.) and a [`ChannelRegistry`]
//! for managing multiple active channel connections.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Each channel adapter owns its own tokio tasks for receiving messages.
//! Incoming messages are pushed into an mpsc channel as [`ChannelMessage`]
//! values that the consuming application polls.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally decoupled from `houston-events` — it produces
//! raw [`ChannelMessage`] values and the application is responsible for
//! mapping them into its own event types.
